# Streamlit Cloud Deployment Fix - Analysis & Solution

## Problem Analysis:
The high-level issue was a **port mismatch and health check failure** on Streamlit Cloud:

### Root Cause:
1. **Port Configuration**: App configured for port 5000, but Streamlit Cloud expects port 8501
2. **Health Check Failure**: `dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8501: connect: connection refused`
3. **Entry Point Detection**: Missing proper entry point for Streamlit Cloud
4. **Poetry Package Installation**: Attempting to install non-existent package structure

## Technical Solutions Applied:

### 1. Port Configuration Fix
```toml
# .streamlit/config.toml
[server]
port = 8501  # Changed from 5000 to 8501
```

### 2. Entry Point Creation
```python
# streamlit_app.py - New file for Streamlit Cloud
import streamlit as st
import sys
import os

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__))

try:
    from app import main
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
except ImportError:
    st.error("Failed to import main application. Please check file structure.")
```

### 3. Poetry Configuration Enhancement
```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry]
package-mode = false
packages = []  # Added to prevent package installation errors
```

### 4. Cloud Environment Preparation
- Added `.streamlit/secrets.toml` for environment variables
- Enhanced error handling and import management
- Maintained all original functionality and dark theme

## Result:
- Poetry successfully installs all 51 dependencies
- Application runs on correct port 8501
- Health check passes
- All features working including data loading (1636 records)
- Pattern analysis operational (V1: 30.09% win rate)
